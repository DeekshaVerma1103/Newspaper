                <p><span class="headline h14">Meeting you felt like the start of something beautiful</span></p></div><p>It all began in the most unexpected way—through Bumble, where conversations bloom from behind screens. But the first time I truly saw him was during something as mundane as a make-up exam. There I was, buried in papers, trying to focus, and then, in a moment that still feels surreal, I looked up and saw him. Not long after, we decided to meet properly at NBC, a cozy little cafe that would soon become the backdrop of one of my favorite memories. I was a bundle of nerves, wondering how it would go, but from the moment we sat down, it felt like I was exactly where I was supposed to be. We talked for hours—two to be exact—but time felt like it slipped away effortlessly. Every word, every laugh, it all felt natural, like coming home to a person I didn’t even know I had been waiting for.

            I still smile when I think about our first order: a double choco chip frappe for him, and a brownie shake with vanilla ice cream for me. As sweet as those drinks were, they couldn’t compare to the warmth that filled my heart that day. Everything just fit. There was no nervousness, no hesitation, effortlessly and beautifully.

            Looking back, that first meeting feels like the perfect beginning to our story. It wasn’t just a date—it was the moment I found someone who made me feel seen, heard, and cherished. And from that day forward, I knew something incredibly special was unfolding, one sweet memory at a time.</p></div>

            <div class="head"><span class="headline hl5">A memorable Valentine</span></div>
            <p>On Valentine's Day, he surprised me by asking me out for a movie. Although nothing had been planned, I was excited. We headed to WTP mall and bought tickets for a unique film about a human-robot relationship. As we settled into our seats, the lights dimmed, and I found myself completely absorbed in the story, sharing laughs and surprised glances with him throughout.

                After the movie, we headed back to the hostel, where I introduced him to my friends. It felt nice seeing him fit into my world so naturally. The highlight of the day was when he handed me a bouquet with a cute teddy bear tucked inside, along with one big chocolate and a flower. The thoughtful gesture caught me off guard, and I couldn’t help but smile.

                That Valentine's Day turned out to be more special than I expected. It was a memorable day, filled with laughter, and it marked an important moment in our growing relationship—one I’ll hold close for a long time.</p>

        <div class="column"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">Making It Official</span></div>

            <p>On the evening of March 1, 2024, a day that coincided with a friend's birthday, what began as an ordinary day turned into a moment that would forever change our lives. As we strolled around the hostel, the atmosphere was filled with easy laughter and lighthearted conversation. He was particularly chatty that evening, which only added to the warmth I felt in his presence. We talked about everything and nothing for hours, completely immersed in each other's company.

                As the clock inched closer to 10:50 PM, signaling it was time for me to head back to my block, we began our walk. Then, in a moment that felt both spontaneous and perfectly planned, he stopped me. With a nervous smile, he looked into my eyes and said, “I like you a lot, so can we go for an official date tomorrow as girlfriend and boyfriend?”

                I was overwhelmed with joy; it was the moment I had been waiting for. His sweet words melted my heart, marking the beautiful transition from friendship to something deeper. That night, as we shared smiles and excitement, I knew we were embarking on a wonderful new chapter together, one filled with promise and affection.</p></div>
        <div class="column"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">A day to remember</span></div><p>After a brief time apart, we reunited for our first date, both back home for a few days—him in Gurgaon and me in Delhi. We had planned a fun day, starting with a movie, and met at a convenient spot before heading to watch Kung Fu Panda 4. It was a lighthearted film, and we both found ourselves laughing throughout.

            Once the credits rolled, we set off to make the most of our day. Our first stop was a charming café tucked away in an army cantonment area, where we ordered lasagna and calzone. Watching him struggle to cut and eat the dishes was adorably cute and brought a smile to my face.

            After our meal, we ventured to the National Museum, which turned out to be a bit underwhelming, but the company made every moment enjoyable. We ended the day at Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place, where, with Holi just around the corner, we playfully colored each other's faces.

            That day was a beautiful mix of laughter, exploration, and simple joys—a day I often wish I could relive, filled with sweet memories that remind me of the magic of our connection.</p></div>

        <div class="column"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">It wasn't a dream </span></div><p> The day after his birthday took an unexpected turn when, during a casual conversation, he asked if we could go for a night out together. It was a new experience for me, and I hesitated for a moment before agreeing. Seeing his excitement as he began making arrangements—booking a car and planning our adventure—made it hard to resist.

            As the evening unfolded, we first tried a café that didn’t quite hit the mark, so we found another one with a much better atmosphere. After enjoying our time there, we decided to explore the city around midnight. I had missed the chance to give him a cake and his gifts on his actual birthday, as he had gone out to party with his friends and returned a little worse for wear. However, we made up for it by cutting the cake in the car, parked by the serene lake—a moment that felt much more special than I had anticipated.

            Then came a surprising moment: he asked if we should kiss. I froze for a second, caught off guard, but then we shared a kiss that was a bit messy yet exhilarating. It was my first kiss, and honestly, it became the best first kiss experience I could have imagined. We ended up making out for the rest of the night, lost in the moment and the magic of it all.

            Our adventure took an amusing turn when we had our first encounter with the police near the lake while still in the car. It was certainly a night to remember, filled with laughter and warmth. Even now, I blush when I think about that feeling, a beautiful mix of excitement and affection that marked the beginning of many more adventures together.</p></div>
